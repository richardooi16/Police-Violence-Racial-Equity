  <h1>Police Brutality and Racial Equity in America</h1>
  <h4>A visualisation by Richard Ooi</h4>

  <h2>Black-White Disparity</h2>
  <p>
    Although not all of the states have <span>high</span> Black-White Disparity, having just a few states
    where the ratios are very high are a concern. Another thing to note is that most if not
    all countries have a non-negative Black-White Disparity, which means there exist <span>some
    inequality</span>, even if it is very slight amount.

  <h2>Annual Police Homicidal Cases</h2>
  <p>
    In these charts below, we can see the average number of murders commited
    by the police annually. As we can see, the numbers in the Homicide Rate for Black
    People have <span>higher numbers on average</span> compared to the numbers in the Homicide Rate
    for White People. Something to note is that the numbers in states such as Nevada and
    New Mexico have extremely high rates, reaching close to <span>30</span> average annual homicides.

  <h2>Race Breakdown</h2>
  <p>
    Here we can see the distribution of race of the people killed by the police. Although
    white people have the highest percentage, they also have the highest population in the
    United States. Therefore, it is reasonable that the percentage being more skewed towards
    white people. However, other races although have a <span>lower population</span> still have quite a 
    <span>high</span> percentage. There are also alot of unknown races but it is usually expected for 
    them to be non-white personnel.

  <p>
    Nowadays, people have been trying to combat the racism that plagues our world. Many people
    have asked for a change in police culture to deal with the corrupt police. [1] Napoleon Wallace,
    a bond analyst, plans to use the bond market to rein in police brutality and make America a
    safer place for people from all walks of life. [2]
