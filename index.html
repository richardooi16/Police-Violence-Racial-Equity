  <h1>Police Brutality and Racial Equity</h1>
  <h4>A visualisation by Richard Ooi</h4>

  <h2>Annual Police Homicidal Cases</h2>
  <p>
    In these charts below, we can see the average number of murders commited
    by the police annually. As we can see, the numbers in the Homicide Rate for Black
    People have higher numbers on average compared to the numbers in the Homicide Rate
    for White People. Something to note is that the numbers in states such as Nevada and
    New Mexico have extremely high rates, reaching close to 30 average annual homicides.

  <h2>Race Breakdown</h2>
  <p>
    Here we can see the distribution of race of the people killed by the police. Although
    white people have the highest percentage, they also have the highest population in the
    United States. Therefore, it is reasonable that the percentage being more skewed towards
    white people. However, other races although have a lower population still have quite a 
    high percentage. There are also alot of unknown races but it is usually expected for 
    them to be non-white personnel.
